vi</span><i>I step across the mystic border-land</i>,<br />
<i>And look upon the wonder-world of Art</i>.<br />
<i>How beautiful</i>, <i>how beautiful its hills</i>!<br />
<i>And all its valleys</i>, <i>how surpassing fair</i>!</p>
<p class="poetry"><i>The winding paths that lead up to the
heights</i><br />
<i>Are polished by the footsteps of the great</i>.<br />
<i>The mountain-peaks stand very near to God</i>:<br />
<i>The chosen few whose feet have trod thereon</i><br />
<i>Have talked with Him</i>, <i>and with the angels
walked</i>.</p>
<p class="poetry"><i>Here are no sounds of discord&mdash;no
profane</i><br />
<i>Or senseless gossip of unworthy things&mdash;</i><br />
<i>Only the songs of chisels and of pens</i>,<br />
<i>Of busy brushes</i>, <i>and ecstatic strains</i><br />
<i>Of souls surcharged with music most divine</i>.<br />
<i>Here is no idle sorrow</i>, <i>no poor grief</i><br />
<i>For any day or object left behind&mdash;</i><br />
<i>For time is counted precious</i>, <i>and herein</i><br />
<i>Is such complete abandonment of Self</i><br />
<i>That tears turn into rainbows</i>, <i>and enhance</i><br />
<i>The beauty of the land where all is fair</i>.<br />
<i>Awed and afraid</i>, <i>I cross the border-land</i>.<br />
<i>Oh</i>, <i>who am I</i>, <i>that I dare enter here</i><br />
<i>Where the great artists of the world have trod&mdash;</i><br
/>
<i>The genius-crowned aristocrats of Earth</i>?<br />
<i>Only the singer of a little song</i>;<br />
<i>Yet loving Art with such a mighty love</i><br />
<i>I hold it greater to have won a place</i><br />
<i>Just on the fair land&rsquo;s edge</i>, <i>to make my
grave</i>,<br />
<i>Than in the outer world of greed and gain</i><br />
<i>To sit upon a royal throne and reign</i>.</p>

<h2><a name="page1"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1</span>WORTH
WHILE</h2>
<p class="poetry">It is easy enough to be pleasant<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When life flows by like a song,<br />
But the man worth while is the one who will smile<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When everything goes dead wrong.<br />
For the test of the heart is trouble,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And it always comes with the years,<br />
And the smile that is worth the praises of earth<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the smile that shines through tears.</p>
<p class="poetry">It is easy enough to be prudent<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When nothing tempts you to stray,<br />
When without or within no voice of sin<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is luring your soul away;<br />
But it&rsquo;s only a negative virtue<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Until it is tried by fire,<br />
And the life that is worth the honour on earth<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the one that resists desire.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

&nbsp;&nbsp; Who had no strength for the strife,<br />
The world&rsquo;s highway is cumbered to-day&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They make up the sum of life;<br />
But the virtue that conquers passion,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the sorrow that hides in a smile&mdash;<br />
It is these that are worth the homage on earth,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For we find them but once in a while.</p>
<h2><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>THE
HOUSE OF LIFE</h2>
<p class="poetry">All wondering, and eager-eyed, within her
portico<br />
I made my plea to Hostess Life, one morning long ago.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Pray show me this great house of thine,
nor close a single door;<br />
But let me wander where I will, and climb from floor to
floor!</p>
<p class="poetry">For many rooms, and curious things, and
treasures great and small<br />
Within your spacious mansion lie, and I would see them
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Then Hostess Life turned silently, her
searching gaze on me,<br />
And with no word, she reached her hand, and offered up the
key.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
4</span>It opened first the door of Hope, and long I lingered
there,<br />
Until I spied the room of Dreams, just higher by a stair.</p>
<p class="poetry">And then a door whereon the one word
&ldquo;Happiness&rdquo; was writ;<br />
But when I tried the little key I could not make it fit.</p>
<p class="poetry">It turned the lock of Pleasure&rsquo;s room,
where first all seemed so bright&mdash;<br />
But after I had stayed awhile it somehow lost its light.</p>
<p class="poetry">And wandering down a lonely hall, I came upon a
room<br />
Marked &ldquo;Duty,&rdquo; and I entered it&mdash;to lose myself
in gloom.</p>
<p class="poetry">Along the shadowy halls I groped my weary way
about,<br />
And found that from dull Duty&rsquo;s room, a door of Toil led
out.</p>
<p class="poetry">It led out to another door, whereon a crimson
stain<br />
Made sullenly against the dark these words: &ldquo;The Room of
Pain.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
5</span>But oh the light, the light, the light, that spilled down
from above<br />
And upward wound, the stairs of Faith, right to the Tower of
Love!</p>
<p class="poetry">And when I came forth from that place, I tried
the little key&mdash;<br />
And lo! the door of Happiness swung open, wide and free.</p>

<p class="poetry">In the rapture of life and of living,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I lift up my heart and rejoice,<br />
And I thank the great Giver for giving<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The soul of my gladness a voice.<br />
In the glow of the glorious weather,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In the sweet-scented, sensuous air,<br />
My burdens seem light as a feather&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They are nothing to bear.</p>
<p class="poetry">In the strength and the glory of power,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In the pride and the pleasure of wealth<br />
(For who dares dispute me my dower<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of talents and youth-time and health?),<br />
I can laugh at the world and its sages&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I am greater than seers who are sad,<br />
For he is most wise in all ages<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who knows how to be glad.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

&nbsp;&nbsp; The god of the beautiful days,<br />
And my spirit soars off like a swallow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And is lost in the light of its rays.<br />
Are you troubled and sad?&nbsp; I beseech you<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Come out of the shadows of strife&mdash;<br />
Come out in the sun while I teach you<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The secret of life.</p>
<p class="poetry">Come out of the world&mdash;come above
it&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Up over its crosses and graves,<br />
Though the green earth is fair and I love it,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We must love it as masters, not slaves.<br />
Come up where the dust never rises&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But only the perfume of flowers&mdash;<br />
And your life shall be glad with surprises<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of beautiful hours.<br />
Come up where the rare golden wine is<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Apollo distills in my sight,<br />
And your life shall be happy as mine is,<br />

<p class="poetry">I do not undertake to say<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That literal answers come from Heaven,<br />
But I know this&mdash;that when I pray<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A comfort, a support is given<br />
That helps me rise o&rsquo;er earthly things<br />
As larks soar up on airy wings.</p>
<p class="poetry">In vain the wise philosopher<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Points out to me my fabric&rsquo;s flaws,<br />
In vain the scientists aver<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That &ldquo;all things are controlled by
laws.&rdquo;<br />
My life has taught me day by day<br />
That it availeth much to pray.</p>
<p class="poetry">I do not stop to reason out<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The why and how.&nbsp; I do not care,<br />
Since I know this, that when I doubt,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Life seems a blackness of despair,<br />
The world a tomb; and when I trust,<br />
Sweet blossoms spring up in the dust.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

&nbsp;&nbsp; If I lift up my soul in prayer,<br />
Some sympathetic, loving Power<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sends hope and comfort to me there.<br />
Since balm is sent to ease my pain,<br />
What need to argue or explain?</p>
<p class="poetry">Prayer has a sweet, refining grace,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; It educates the soul and heart.<br />
It lends a lustre to the face,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And by its elevating art<br />
It gives the mind an inner sight<br />
That brings it near the Infinite.</p>
<p class="poetry">From our gross selves it helps us rise<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To something which we yet may be.<br />
And so I ask not to be wise,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; If thus my faith is lost to me.<br />
Faith, that with angel&rsquo;s voice and touch<br />
Says, &ldquo;Pray, for prayer availeth much.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="poetry">In the long run fame finds the deserving
man.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The lucky wight may prosper for a day,<br />
But in good time true merit leads the van<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And vain pretence, unnoticed, goes its way.<br />
There is no Chance, no Destiny, no Fate,<br />
But Fortune smiles on those who work and wait,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the long run.</p>
<p class="poetry">In the long run all godly sorrow pays,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no better thing than righteous pain,<br />
The sleepless nights, the awful thorn-crowned days,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Bring sure reward to tortured soul and brain.<br />
Unmeaning joys enervate in the end,<br />
But sorrow yields a glorious dividend<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the long run.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

All the unspoken motives of the breast<br />
Are fathomed by the years and stand confess&rsquo;d<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the long run.</p>
<p class="poetry">In the long run all love is paid by love,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Though undervalued by the hosts of earth;<br />
The great eternal Government above<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Keeps strict account and will redeem its worth.<br

Give thy love freely; do not count the cost;<br />

GO THROUGH LIFE</h2>
<p class="poetry">Don&rsquo;t look for the flaws as you go
through life;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And even when you find them,<br />
It is wise and kind to be somewhat blind,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And look for the virtue behind them;<br />
For the cloudiest night has a hint of light<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Somewhere in its shadows hiding;<br />
It&rsquo;s better by far to hunt for a star,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Than the spots on the sun abiding.</p>
<p class="poetry">The current of life runs ever away<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To the bosom of God&rsquo;s great ocean.<br />
Don&rsquo;t set your force &rsquo;gainst the river&rsquo;s
course,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And think to alter its motion.<br />
Don&rsquo;t waste a curse on the universe,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Remember, it lived before you;<br />
Don&rsquo;t butt at the storm with your puny form,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But bend and let it go o&rsquo;er you.</p>

It is folly to fight with the Infinite,<br />

To plunge into the great world&rsquo;s strife</p>
<p class="poetry">That fills young hearts with mad desire,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He saw a sunset.&nbsp; Red and gold<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; Such intense joy, it hurt like pain.<br />

<p class="poetry">So near the Unknown seemed, so close<br />

Went trickling downward through each vein.</p>
<p class="poetry">And in his heart the whole day long,<br />

The beauty of that singer&rsquo;s song.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; His smouldering heart flamed into fire&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He had his one supreme desire,<br />
And plunged into the world of men.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; With pleasures of the grosser kind<br />

Till, shamed, he sated, turned away.</p>

18</span>UNREST</h2>
<p class="poetry">In the youth of the year, when the birds were
building,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When the green was showing on tree and hedge,<br />
And the tenderest light of all lights was gilding<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The world from zenith to outermost edge,<br />
My soul grew sad and longingly lonely!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I sighed for the season of sun and rose,<br />
And I said, &ldquo;In the Summer and that time only<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Lies sweet contentment and blest repose.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">With bee and bird for her maids of honour<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Came Princess Summer in robes of green.<br />
And the King of day smiled down upon her<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And wooed her, and won her, and made her queen.<br
/>
Fruit of their union and true love&rsquo;s pledges,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Beautiful roses bloomed day by day,<br />
And rambled in gardens and hid in hedges<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like royal children in sportive play.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>My restless soul for a little season<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Revelled in rapture of glow and bloom,<br />
And then, like a subject who harbours treason,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Grew full of rebellion and grey with gloom.<br />
And I said, &ldquo;I am sick of the summer&rsquo;s blisses,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of warmth and beauty, and nothing more.<br />
The full fruition my sad soul misses<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That beauteous Fall-time holds in store!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">But now when the colours are almost
blinding,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Burning and blending on bush and tree,<br />
And the rarest fruits are mine for the finding,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the year is ripe as a year can be,<br />
My soul complains in the same old fashion;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Crying aloud in my troubled breast<br />
Is the same old longing, the same old passion.<br />

<p class="poetry">I think I never passed so sad an hour,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Dear friend, as that one at the church to-night.<br

The edifice from basement to the tower<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Was one resplendent blaze of coloured light.<br />
Up through broad aisles the stylish crowd was thronging,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Each richly robed like some king&rsquo;s bidden
guest.<br />
&ldquo;Here will I bring my sorrow and my longing,&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I said, &ldquo;and here find rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">I heard the heavenly organ&rsquo;s voice of

&nbsp;&nbsp; I dried my tears: their gaze profaned my grief.<br

Wrapt in the costly furs, and silks, and laces,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Beat alien hearts, that had no part with me.<br />
I could not read, in all those proud cold faces,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; One thought of sympathy.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

&nbsp;&nbsp; Heard their responses like sweet waters roll<br />
But only the glorious organ&rsquo;s sacred pealing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Seemed gushing from a full and fervent soul.<br />
I listened to the man of holy calling,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He spoke of creeds, and hailed his own as best;<br
/>
Of man&rsquo;s corruption and of Adam&rsquo;s-falling,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But naught that gave me rest:</p>
<p class="poetry">Nothing that helped me bear the daily
grinding<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of soul with body, heart with heated brain;<br />
Nothing to show the purpose of this blinding<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And sometimes overwhelming sense of pain.<br />
And then, dear friend, I thought of thee, so lowly,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So unassuming, and so gently kind,<br />
And lo! a peace, a calm serene and holy,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Settled upon my mind.</p>
<p class="poetry">Ah, friend, my friend! one true heart, fond and
tender,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That understands our troubles and our needs,<br />
Brings us more near to God than all the splendour<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And pomp of seeming worship and vain creeds.<br />
One glance of thy dear eyes so full of feeling,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Doth bring me closer to the Infinite<br />
Than all that throng of worldly people kneeling<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In blaze of gorgeous light.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; Whoever has bathed in that sea,<br />
All dangers, all deaths, they defy them,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And are gladder than gods are, with glee.</p>

Upon the shuttles of the future years<br />
A fabric far more durable.&nbsp; Subdued,<br />
It may be, in the blending of its hues,<br />

My new robe shall be richer than the old.</p>

They spoke of vast convulsions which would be<br />

All things give way before it, soon or late.<br />

The ice-bound Earth but mocked their puny might,<br />
Far better had the fixedness of white<br />
And uncomplaining snows&mdash;which make no sign,<br />
But coldly smile, when pitying moonbeams shine&mdash;<br />
Concealed its sorrow from all human sight.<br />
Long, long ago, in blurred and burdened years,<br />
I learned the uselessness of uttered woe.<br />
Though sinewy Fate deals her most skilful blow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I do not waste the gall now of my tears,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But feed my pride upon its bitter, while<br />

As some young roe, he speeds by vale and sea,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By flowery mead, by mountain peak sublime,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And all the world seems motion set to rhyme,<br />
Till, tired out, he cries, &ldquo;Now carry me!&rdquo;<br />

And seizes on us.&nbsp; God! he goads us so!<br />

At each new step we feel the burden grow,<br />
Till our bent backs seem breaking as we go,<br />

KISSES</h2>

I</h3>
<p class="poetry">Love breathed a secret to her listening
heart,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And said &ldquo;Be silent.&rdquo;&nbsp; Though she
guarded it,<br />
And dwelt as one within a world apart,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet sun and star seemed by that secret lit.<br />
And where she passed, each whispering wind ablow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And every little blossom in the sod,<br />
Called joyously to her, &ldquo;We know, we know,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For are we not the intimates of God?&rdquo;<br />
Life grew so radiant, and so opulent,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That when her fragile body and her brain<br />
By mortal throes of agony were rent,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She felt a curious rapture in her pain.<br />
Then, after anguish, came the supreme bliss&mdash;<br />
They brought the little baby, for her kiss!</p>

II</h3>
<p class="poetry">There was a little pause between the dances;<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Without, somewhere, a tinkling fountain played.<br
/>
The dusky path was lit by ardent glances<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As forth they fared, a lover and a maid.<br />
He chose a nook, from curious eyes well hidden&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; All redolent with sweet midsummer charm,<br />
And by the great primeval instinct bidden,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He drew her in the shelter of his arm.<br />
The words that long deep in his heart had trembled<br />
Found sudden utterance; she at first dissembled,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Refused her lips, and half withdrew her hand,<br />
Then murmured &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; and yielded, woman fashion,<br
/>
Her virgin mouth to young love&rsquo;s kiss of passion.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">The Bridal Kiss</span><br />
III</h3>
<p class="poetry">As fleecy clouds trail back across the
skies,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Showing the sweet young moon in azure space,<br />

A sudden wonder to his eager eyes.<br />
<a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>In that
familiar beauty lurked surprise:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For now the wife stood in the maiden&rsquo;s

And love&rsquo;s large pride grown trebly fair and wise.</p>
<p class="poetry">The world receded, leaving them alone.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The universe was theirs, from sphere to sphere,<br

And life assumed new meaning, and new worth.<br />
Love held no privilege they did not own,<br />

And she a matron in her fullest flower.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The mantel clock gave forth a warning chime.<br />
She put her work aside; his bright cigar<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Grew pale, and crumbled in an ashen heap.<br />
The lights went out, save one remaining star<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That watched beside the children in their sleep.<br

She hummed a little song and nestled near,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As side by side they went to their repose.<br />
<a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>His arm
about her waist, he whispered &ldquo;Dear,&rdquo;<br />

Bringing forgotten names and faces near;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; While lost in mist, the present fades away.<br />
The fragrant winds of tender memories blow<br />

And then another through my own, and so<br />

So, past all parting, I should claim thee mine.<br />
Dead with our youth, and faith, and love divine,<br />
Should we not keep the best of life that way?<br />
What shall we gain by living day on day?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What shall we
gain,<br />

I hurried away from the gateway,<br />
For my soul and my spirit said straightway.<br />
&ldquo;This is not the road to Content.&rdquo;</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; Lo! it led to the realm God selected<br />
To crown with His best gifts of beauty,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; For a million billion people.<br />
What greater bliss could we ask than this,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To sweep with a bird&rsquo;s free motion<br />
Through leagues of space to a resting place,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In a vast and vapoury ocean&mdash;<br />
To pass away from this life for aye<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With never a dear tie sundered,<br />
And a world on fire for a funeral pyre,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; While the stars looked on and wondered?</p>

79</span>THROUGH DIM EYES</h2>
<p class="poetry">Is it the world, or my eyes, that are
sadder?<br />
I see not the grace that I used to see<br />
In the meadow-brook whose song was so glad, or<br />
In the boughs of the willow tree.<br />
The brook runs slower&mdash;its song seems lower<br />
And not the song that it sang of old;<br />
And the tree I admired looks weary and tired<br />
Of the changeless story of heat and cold.</p>
<p class="poetry">When the sun goes up, and the stars go
under,<br />
In that supreme hour of the breaking day,<br />
Is it my eyes, or the dawn, I wonder,<br />
That finds less of the gold, and more of the gray<br />
I see not the splendour, the tints so tender,<br />
The rose-hued glory I used to see;<br />
And I often borrow a vague half-sorrow<br />
That another morning has dawned for me.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
80</span>When the royal smile of that welcome comer<br />
Beams on the meadow and burns in the sky,<br />
Is it my eyes, or does the Summer<br />
Bring less of bloom than in days gone by?<br />
The beauty that thrilled me, the rapture that filled me,<br />
To an overflowing of happy tears,<br />
I pass unseeing, my sad eyes being<br />
Dimmed by the shadow of vanished years.</p>
<p class="poetry">When the heart grows weary, all things seem
dreary;<br />
When the burden grows heavy, the way seems long.<br />
Thank God for sending kind death as an ending,<br />
Like a grand Amen to a minor song.</p>

Beholding men, they fear them.&nbsp; But at length,<br />
Grown all too great and active for the heart<br />
That broods them with such tender mother art,<br />
Forgetting fear, and men, and all, that hour,<br />

That stirs within them&mdash;they shall soar away<br />
Up to the very portals of the Day.</p>

Whereon doth lie that dreamed-of rest serene.<br />

Alas!&nbsp; I murmured, that the Year should borrow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So soon a sorrow.<br />
Just then the sunlight fell with sudden flame:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tear became<br />
A wondrous diamond sparkling in the light&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A beauteous sight.</p>
<p class="poetry">Upon my soul there fell such woeful loss,<br />

Over the knoll in the valley yonder<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The loveliest buttercups bloomed and grew;<br />
When the snow has gone that drifted them under,<br />

GIRL&rsquo;S FAITH</h2>
<p class="poetry">Across the miles that stretch between,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Through days of gloom or glad sunlight,<br />
There shines a face I have not seen<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which yet doth make my world more bright.</p>
<p class="poetry">He may be near, he may be far,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or near or far I cannot see,<br />
But faithful as the morning star<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He yet shall rise and come to me.</p>
<p class="poetry">What though fate leads us separate ways,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The world is round, and time is fleet.<br />
A journey of a few brief days,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And face to face we two shall meet.</p>
<p class="poetry">Shall meet beneath God&rsquo;s arching
skies,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; While suns shall blaze, or stars shall gleam,<br />
And looking in each other&rsquo;s eyes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall hold the past but as a dream.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; As back of dawns the sunbeams play,<br />
There shines the face I have not seen,<br />

107</span>TWO</h2>
<p class="poetry">One leaned on velvet cushions like a
queen&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To see him pass, the hero of an hour,<br />
Whom men called great.&nbsp; She bowed with languid mien,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And smiled, and blushed, and knew her beauty&rsquo;s
power.</p>
<p class="poetry">One trailed her tinselled garments through the
street,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And thrust aside the crowd, and found a place<br />
So near, the blooded courser&rsquo;s prancing feet<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Cast sparks of fire upon her painted face.</p>
<p class="poetry">One took the hot-house blossoms from her
breast,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And tossed them down, as he went riding by,<br />
And blushed rose-red to see them fondly pressed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To bearded lips, while eye spoke unto eye.</p>
<p class="poetry">One, bold and hardened with her sinful life,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet shrank and shivered painfully, because<br />
His cruel glance cut keener than a knife,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The glance of him who made her what she was.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

109</span>SLIPPING AWAY</h2>
<p class="poetry">Slipping away&mdash;slipping away!<br />
Out of our brief year slips the May;<br />
And Winter lingers, and Summer flies;<br />
And Sorrow abideth, and Pleasure dies;<br />
And the days are short, and the nights are long;<br />
And little is right, and much is wrong.</p>
<p class="poetry">Slipping away is the Summer time;<br />
It has lost its rhythm and lilting rhyme&mdash;<br />
For the grace goes out of the day so soon,<br />
And the tired head aches in the glare of noon,<br />
And the way seems long to the hills that lie<br />
Under the calm of the western sky.</p>
<p class="poetry">Slipping away are the friends whose worth<br />
Lent a glow to the sad old earth:<br />
One by one they slip from our sight;<br />
One by one their graves gleam white;<br />
Or we count them lost by the crueller death<br />
Of a trust betrayed, or a murdered faith.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
110</span>Slipping away are the hopes that made<br />
Bliss out of sorrow, and sun out of shade,<br />
Slipping away is our hold on life;<br />
And out of the struggle and wearing strife,<br />
From joys that diminish, and woes that increase,<br />
We are slipping away to the shores of Peace.</p>

IT DONE?</h2>
<p class="poetry">It is done! in the fire&rsquo;s fitful
flashes,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The last line has withered and curled.<br />
In a tiny white heap of dead ashes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Lie buried the hopes of your world.<br />
There were mad foolish vows in each letter,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; It is well they have shrivelled and burned,<br />
And the ring! oh, the ring was a fetter,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; It was better removed and returned.</p>
<p class="poetry">But ah, is it done?&nbsp; In the embers<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where letters and tokens were cast,<br />
Have you burned up the heart that remembers,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And treasures its beautiful past?<br />
Do you think in this swift reckless fashion<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To ruthlessly burn and destroy<br />
The months that were freighted with passion,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The dreams that were drunken with joy?</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
112</span>Can you burn up the rapture of kisses<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That flashed from the lips to the soul,<br />
Or the heart that grows sick for lost blisses<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In spite of its strength of control?<br />
Have you burned up the touch of warm fingers<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That thrilled through each pulse and each vein,<br
/>
Or the sound of a voice that still lingers<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And hurts with a haunting refrain?</p>
<p class="poetry">Is it done? is the life drama ended?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; You have put all the lights out, and yet,<br />
Though the curtain, rung down, has descended,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Can the actors go home and forget?<br />
Ah, no! they will turn in their sleeping<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With a strange restless pain in their hearts,<br />
And in darkness, and anguish, and weeping,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Will dream they are playing their parts.</p>

<p class="poetry">Somebody said, in the crowd, last eve,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That you were married, or soon to be.<br />
I have not thought of you, I believe,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Since last we parted.&nbsp; Let me see:<br />
Five long Summers have passed since then&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Each has been pleasant in its own way&mdash;<br />
And you are but one of a dozen men<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who have played the suitor a Summer day.</p>
<p class="poetry">But, nevertheless, when I heard your name,<br

&nbsp;&nbsp; Coupled with some one&rsquo;s, not my own,<br />
There burned in my bosom a sudden flame,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That carried me back to the day that is flown.<br />
I was sitting again by the laughing brook,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With you at my feet, and the sky above,<br />
And my heart was fluttering under your look&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The unmistakable look of Love.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

&nbsp;&nbsp; My cheek, where the blushes came and went;<br />
And the tender clasp of your strong, warm hand<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sudden thrills through my pulses sent.<br />
Again you were mine by Love&rsquo;s own right&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Mine for ever by Love&rsquo;s decree:<br />
So for a moment it seemed last night,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When somebody mentioned your name to me.</p>
<p class="poetry">Just for the moment I thought you
mine&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Loving me, wooing me, as of old.<br />
The tale remembered seemed half divine&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Though I held it lightly enough when told.<br />
The past seemed fairer than when it was near,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As &ldquo;blessings brighten when taking
flight;&rdquo;<br />
And just for the moment I held you dear&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When somebody mentioned your name last night.</p>

<p class="poetry">In a garb that was guiltless of colours<br />

A creature of dumps and of dolours,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But most undeniably fair.</p>
<p class="poetry">The folds of her garment fell round her,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Revealing the curve of each limb;<br />
Well proportioned and graceful I found her,<br />

sandal&mdash;<br />

And though I could not understand all<br />

<p class="poetry">Impressed by her limpness and languor,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I proffered a chair near at hand;<br />

<p class="poetry">I then, in a strain quite poetic,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Begged her gaze on the bow in the sky,<br />
She looked&mdash;said its curve was
&ldquo;&aelig;sthetic.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But the &ldquo;tone was too dreadfully
high.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Her lovely face, lit by the splendour<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That glorified landscape and sea,<br />
Woke thoughts that were daring and tender:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Did <i>her</i> thoughts, too, rest upon me?</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Oh, tell me,&rdquo; I cried, growing
bolder,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Have I in your musings a place?&rdquo;<br />

<h3>SUNDAY</h3>
<p class="poetry">Lie still and rest, in that serene repose<br />
That on this holy morning comes to those<br />
Who have been burdened with the cares which make<br />
The sad heart weary and the tired head ache.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lie still and rest&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; God&rsquo;s day of all is best.</p>
<h3>MONDAY</h3>
<p class="poetry">Awake! arise!&nbsp; Cast off thy drowsy
dreams!<br />
Red in the East, behold the Morning gleams.<br />

Another day looks smiling on the world.<br />
It holds new laurels for thy soul to win;<br />
Mar not its grace by slothfulness or sin,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor sad, away,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Send it to yesterday.</p>
<h3>WEDNESDAY</h3>
<p class="poetry">Half-way unto the end&mdash;the week&rsquo;s
high noon.<br />
The morning hours do speed away so soon!<br />
And, when the noon is reached, however bright,<br />
Instinctively we look toward the night.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The glow is lost<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Once the meridian cross&rsquo;d.</p>
<h3>THURSDAY</h3>
<p class="poetry">So well the week has sped, hast thou a
friend,<br />
Go spend an hour in converse.&nbsp; It will lend<br />
New beauty to thy labours and thy life<br />
To pause a little sometimes in the strife.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Toil soon seems rude<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That has no interlude.</p>

Not many hours are left thee for thy work&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And it were meet<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That all should be complete.</p>
<h3>SATURDAY</h3>
<p class="poetry">Now with the almost finished task make
haste.<br />
So near the night thou hast no time to waste.<br />
Post up accounts, and let thy Soul&rsquo;s eyes look<br />
For flaws and errors in Life&rsquo;s ledger-book.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When labours cease,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; How sweet the sense of peace!</p>

<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are
ghosts in the room.<br />
As I sit here alone, from the dark corners there<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They come out of the gloom,<br />
And they stand at my side and they lean on my chair.</p>
<p

<p class="poetry">My thoughts soar not as they ought to soar,<br

&nbsp;&nbsp; Higher and higher on soul-lent wings;<br />
But ever and often, and more and more<br />

By little troubles and little needs,<br />
As a lark might be tangled among the weeds.</p>
<p class="poetry">My purpose is not what it ought to be,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Steady and fixed, like a star on high,<br />
But more like a fisherman&rsquo;s light at sea;<br />

Sometimes feeble, and sometimes bright,<br />
Then suddenly lost in the gloom of night.</p>
<p class="poetry">My life is far from my dream of life&mdash;<br

&nbsp;&nbsp; Calmly contented, serenely glad;<br />
But, vexed and worried by daily strife,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; It is always troubled, and ofttimes sad&mdash;<br />
And the heights I had thought I should reach one day<br />
Grow dimmer and dimmer, and farther away.</p>

Is the higher self that I long to be.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; To satisfy my mind.</p>

SAT DOWN</h2>
<p class="poetry">Two sat down in the morning time,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; One to sing and one to spin.<br />
All men listened the song sublime&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But no one listened the dull wheel&rsquo;s din.</p>
<p class="poetry">The singer sat in a pleasant nook,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And sang of a life that was fair and sweet,<br />
While the spinner sat with a steadfast look,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Busily plying her hands and feet.</p>
<p class="poetry">The singer sang on with a rose in her hair,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; And all men listened her dulcet tone;<br />
And the spinner spun on with a dull despair<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Down in her heart as she sat alone.</p>
<p class="poetry">But lo! on the morrow no one said<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Aught of the singer or what she sang.<br />
Men were saying: &ldquo;Behold this thread,&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And loud the praise of the spinner rang.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
136</span>The world has forgotten the singer&rsquo;s
name&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her rose is faded, her songs are old;<br />
But far o&rsquo;er the ocean the spinner&rsquo;s fame<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet is blazoned in lines of gold.</p>

137</span>BOUND AND FREE</h2>
<p class="poetry">Come to me, Love!&nbsp; Come on the wings of
the wind!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Fly as the ring-dove would fly to his mate!<br />
Leave all your cares and your sorrows behind!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Leave all the fears of your future to Fate!<br />
Come! and our skies shall be glad with the gold<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That paled into gray when you parted from me.<br />
Come! but remember that, just as of old,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; You must be bound, Love, and I must be free.</p>
<p class="poetry">Life has lost savour since you and I parted;<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; I have been lonely, and you have been sad.<br />
Youth is too brief to be sorrowful-hearted&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Come! and again let us laugh and be glad.<br />
Lips should not sigh that are fashioned to kiss&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Breasts should not ache that joy&rsquo;s secrets
have found.<br />
Come! but remember, in spite of all this,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I must be free, Love, while you must be bound.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
138</span>You must be bound to be true while you live,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And I keep my freedom for ever, as now.<br />
You must ask only for that which I give&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Kisses and love-words, but never a vow.<br />
Come!&nbsp; I am lonely, and long for your smile,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Bring back the lost lovely Summer to me!<br />
Come! but remember, remember the while,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That you must be bound, Love, and I must be
free.</p>

139</span>AQUILEIA</h2>
<p>[On the election of the Roman Emperor Maximus, by the Senate,
<span class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 238, a powerful army, headed
by the Thracian giant Maximus, laid siege to Aquileia.&nbsp;
Though poorly prepared for war, the constancy of her citizens
rendered her impregnable.&nbsp; The women of Aquileia cut off
their hair to make ropes for the military engines.&nbsp; The
small body of troops was directed by Chrispinus, a Lieutenant of
the Senate.&nbsp; Apollo was the deity supposed to protect
them.&mdash;<i>Gibbon&rsquo;s Roman History</i>.]</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;The ropes, the ropes!&nbsp; Apollo send
us ropes,&rdquo;<br />
Chrispinus cried, &ldquo;or death attends our hopes.&rdquo;<br />
Then panic reigned, and many a mournful sound<br />
Hurt the cleft air; for where could ropes be found?</p>
<p class="poetry">Up rose a Roman mother; tall was she<br />
As her own son, a youth of noble height.<br />
A little child was clinging to her knee&mdash;<br />
She loosed his twining arms and put him down,<br />
And her dark eyes flashed with a sudden light.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
140</span>How like a queen she stood! her royal crown,<br />
The rich dark masses of her splendid hair.<br />
Just flecked with spots of sunshine here and there,<br />
Twined round her brow; &rsquo;twas like a coronet,<br />
Where gems of gold lie bedded deep in jet.</p>
<p class="poetry">She loosed the comb that held the shining
strands,<br />
And threaded out the meshes with her hands.<br />
The purple mass fell to her garment&rsquo;s hem.<br />
A queen new clothed without her diadem<br />
She stood before her subjects.</p>
<p
class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Now,&rdquo;
she cried,<br />
&ldquo;Give me thy sword, Julianus!&rdquo;&nbsp; And her son<br
/>
Unsheathed the blade (that had not left his side<br />
Save when it sought a foeman&rsquo;s blood to shed),<br />
Awed by her regal bearing, and obeyed.</p>
<p class="poetry">With the white beauty of her firm fair hand<br
/>
She clasped the hilt; then severed, one by one,<br />
Her gold-flecked purple tresses.&nbsp; Strand on strand,<br />
Free e&rsquo;en as foes had fallen by that blade,<br />
Robbed of its massive wealth of curl and coil,<br />
Yet like some antique model, rose her head<br />
In all its classic beauty.</p>
<p
class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a
name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
141</span>&ldquo;See!&rdquo; she said,<br />
And pointed to the shining mound of hair;<br />
&ldquo;Apollo makes swift answer to thy prayer,<br />
Chrispinus.&nbsp; Quick! now, soldiers, to thy toil!&rdquo;<br />
Forth from a thousand throats what seemed one voice<br />
Rose shrilly, filling all the air with cheer.<br />
&ldquo;Lo!&rdquo; quoth the foe, &ldquo;our enemies
rejoice!&rdquo;<br />
Well might the Thracian giant quake with fear!<br />
For while skilled hands caught up the gleaming threads<br />
And bound them into cords, a hundred heads<br />
Yielded their beauteous tresses to the sword,<br />
And cast them down to swell the precious hoard.</p>
<p class="poetry">Nor was the noble sacrifice in vain<br />
Another day beheld the giant slain.</p>

142</span>WISHES FOR A LITTLE GIRL</h2>
<p class="poetry">What would I ask the kindly fates to give<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To crown her life, if I could have my way?<br />
My strongest wishes would be negative,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; If they would but obey.</p>
<p class="poetry">Give her not greatness.&nbsp; For great souls
must stand<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Alone and lonely in this little world:<br />
Cleft rocks that show the great Creator&rsquo;s hand,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thither by earthquakes hurled.</p>
<p class="poetry">Give her not genius.&nbsp; Spare her the cruel
pain<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of finding her whole life a prey for daws;<br />
Of hearing with quickened sense and burning brain<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The world&rsquo;s sneer-tinged applause.</p>
<p class="poetry">Give her not perfect beauty&rsquo;s
gifts.&nbsp; For then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her truthful mirror would infuse her mind<br />
With love for self, and for the praise of men,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That lowers woman-kind.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
143</span>But make her fair and comely to the sight,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Give her more heart than brain, more love than
pride.<br />
Let her be tender-thoughted, cheerful, bright,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Some strong man&rsquo;s star and guide.</p>
<p class="poetry">Not vainly questioning why she was sent<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Into this restless world of toil and strife,<br />
Let her go bravely on her way, content<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To make the best of life.</p>

<p class="poetry">Nay, Romney, nay&mdash;I will not hear you
say<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Those words again: &ldquo;I love you, love you
sweet!&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; You are profane&mdash;blasphemous.&nbsp; I
repeat,<br />
You are no actor for so grand a play.</p>
<p class="poetry">You love with all your heart?&nbsp; Well, that
may be;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Some cups are fashioned shallow.&nbsp; Should I
try<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To quench my thirst from one of those, when
dry&mdash;<br />
I who have had a full bowl proffered me&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">A new bowl brimming with a draught divine,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; One single taste thrilled to the finger-tips?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Think you I even care to bathe my lips<br />
With this poor sweetened water you call wine?</p>
<p class="poetry">And though I spilled the nectar ere &rsquo;twas
quaffed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And broke the bowl in wanton folly, yet<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I would die of my thirst ere I would wet<br />
My burning lips with any meaner draught.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
145</span>So leave me, Romney.&nbsp; One who has seen a play<br

&nbsp;&nbsp; Enacted by a star cannot endure<br />

You know not what Love is&mdash;now go away!</p>
<h2><a name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 146</span>MY
HOME</h2>
<p class="poetry">This is the place that I love the best,<br />
A little brown house like a ground-bird&rsquo;s nest,<br />
Hid among grasses, and vines, and trees,<br />
Summer retreat of the birds and bees.</p>
<p class="poetry">The tenderest light that ever was seen<br />
Sifts through the vine-made window screen&mdash;<br />
Sifts and quivers, and flits and falls<br />
On home-made carpets and gray-hung walls.</p>
<p class="poetry">All through June, the west wind free<br />
The breath of the clover brings to me.<br />
All through the languid July day<br />
I catch the scent of the new-mown hay.</p>
<p class="poetry">The morning glories and scarlet vine<br />
Over the doorway twist and twine;<br />
And every day, when the house is still,<br />
The humming-bird comes to the window-sill.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
147</span>In the cunningest chamber under the sun<br />
I sink to sleep when the day is done;<br />
And am waked at morn, in my snow-white bed,<br />
By a singing-bird on the roof o&rsquo;erhead.</p>
<p class="poetry">Better than treasures brought from Rome<br />
Are the living pictures I see at home&mdash;<br />
My aged father, with frosted hair,<br />
And mother&rsquo;s face like a painting rare<br />
Far from the city&rsquo;s dust and heat,<br />
I get but sounds and odours sweet.<br />
Who can wonder I love to stay,<br />
Week after week, here hidden away,<br />
In this sly nook that I love the best&mdash;<br />
The little brown house, like a ground-bird&rsquo;s nest?</p>

Marriage oft means care and worry.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Auntie says, with manner grave,<br />
&ldquo;Wife is synonym for slave.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Father asks, in tones commanding,<br />

AFTERNOON</h2>
<p class="poetry">I am stirred by the dream of an afternoon<br />
Of a perfect day&mdash;though it was not June;<br />
The lilt of winds, and the droning tune<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That a busy city was humming.</p>
<p class="poetry">And a bronze-brown head, and lips like wine<br
/>
Leaning out through the window-vine<br />
A-list for steps that were maybe mine&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Eager steps that were coming.</p>
<p class="poetry">I can see it all, as a dreamer may&mdash;<br />
The tender smile on your lips that day,<br />
And the glow on your cheek as we rode away<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Into the golden weather.</p>
<p class="poetry">And a love-light shone in your eyes of
brown&mdash;<br />
I swear there did!&mdash;as we drove down<br />
The crowded avenue out of the town,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Through shadowy lanes, together:</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
151</span>Drove out into the sunset-skies<br />
That glowed with wonderful crimson dyes;<br />
And with soul and spirit, and heart and eyes,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We silently drank their splendour.</p>
<p class="poetry">But the golden glory that lit the place<br />
Was not alone from the sunset&rsquo;s grace&mdash;<br />
For I saw in your fair, uplifted face<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A light that was wondrously tender.</p>
<p class="poetry">I say I saw it.&nbsp; And yet to-day<br />
I ask myself, in a cynical way,<br />
Was it only a part you had learned to play,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To see me act the lover?</p>
<p class="poetry">And I curse myself for a fool.&nbsp; And yet<br
/>
I would willingly die without one regret<br />
Could I bring back the day whose sun has set&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And you&mdash;and live it over.</p>

152</span>RIVER AND SEA</h2>
<p class="poetry">We stood by the river that swept<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In its glory and grandeur away;<br />
But never a pulse o&rsquo; me leapt,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And you wondered at me that day.</p>
<p class="poetry">We stood by the lake as it lay<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With its dimpled face turned to the light;<br />
Was it strange I had nothing to say<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To so fair and enchanting a sight?</p>
<p class="poetry">I look on your tresses of gold&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; You are fair and a thing to be loved&mdash;<br />
Do you think I am heartless and cold<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That I look and am wholly unmoved?</p>
<p class="poetry">One answer, dear friend, I will make<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To the questions your eyes ask of me:<br />
&ldquo;Talk not of the river or lake<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To those who have looked on the sea&rdquo;</p>

<p class="poetry">When thy hand touches mine, through all the
mesh<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of intricate and interlac&egrave;d veins<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shoot swift delights that border on keen pains:<br
/>
Flesh thrills to thrilling flesh.</p>
<p class="poetry">When in thine eager eyes I look to find<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A comrade to my thought, thy ready brain<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Delves down and makes its inmost meaning plain:<br
/>
Mind answers unto mind.</p>
<p class="poetry">When hands and eyes are hid by seas that
roll<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wide wastes between us, still so near thou art<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I count the very pulses of thy heart:<br />
Soul speaketh unto soul.</p>
<p class="poetry">So every law, or human or divine,<br />
In heart and brain and spirit makes thee mine.</p>

154</span>POSSESSION</h2>
<p class="poetry">That which we had we still possess,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Though leaves may drop and stars may fall;<br />
No circumstance can make it less,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or take it from us, all in all.</p>
<p class="poetry">That which is lost we did not own;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We only held it for a day&mdash;<br />
A leaf by careless breezes blown;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No fate could take our own away.</p>
<p class="poetry">I hold it as a changeless law<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From which no soul can sway or swerve,<br />
We have that in us which will draw<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whate&rsquo;er we need or most deserve.</p>
<p class="poetry">Even as the magnet to the steel<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Our souls are to our best desires;<br />
The Fates have hearts and they can feel&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They know what each true life requires.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

&nbsp;&nbsp; We call joys ended ere begun;<br />
When stars fade out do skies complain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or glory in the rising sun?</p>
<p class="poetry">No fate could rob us of our own&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No circumstance can make it less;<br />
What time removes was but a loan,<br />

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
